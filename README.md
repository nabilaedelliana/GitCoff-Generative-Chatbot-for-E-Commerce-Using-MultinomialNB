The chatbot takes generative concept for that can recognize similar text-input for specific tag and gives variative responses.

This chatbot is quite better over the others because the other chatbots using dictionary concept where the model can't recognize similar text-input for specific tag. The other chatbots require an identical text-input to recognize the tag.

## Objectives
This Project aims to create a user-friendly chatbot (GitCoff" for e-commerce "GitCoffee" to help communicating with customers in the more effective way for non-technical question with the concept of machine learning and NLP.

## Dataset
The dataset is built and improved along the model improvisation. We built our own dataset in order to have a relevan dataset and in to complete the aims of the objectives.
1. Intents : contains 3 informations, dataset for the chatbot
    - tag : defines the class of the question/input and the answer/output.
    - pattern : the data that represent the input for GitCoff from user/customer and will be trained later to the model.
    - responses : defines the responses that will be selected randomly as the output for the input.
2. data_kopi.csv : contains 8 informations about data coffee, dataset for recommeder system.
